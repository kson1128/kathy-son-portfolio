                We can all agree that music connects people regardless of their
                background, social status, and culture. As an electronic music
                fanatic, I have struggled to find new music and people to
                connect with. That was the idea that is now known as Genzi, a
                social media platform to share music and connect with other
                people with similar musical styles. <br />

                As we started the project, one of our main focuses was to create
                a following on social media. Different approaches were taken
                into consideration including the design process, interactive
                videos, interviews, and building a start-up process. Within a
                few months, our videos reached 500,000+ accounts. As we continue
                to upload videos, our extrinsic motivation kept rising,
                reinforcing and validating the idea of Genzi. <br />

        <div class="main-text">
          As the co-founder and UX <strong>| </strong>UI Designer, my role
          includes a bit of everything. During the first phase, I worked along
          with my co-founder to have a detailed market analysis of the business
          plan including key competitors, user&#x27;s needs, and gaps and
          opportunities in the market. Together we brainstormed ideas and
          designs for the lo-fi version and wireframe of the application. As we
          shaped our idea, we started sharing a transparent journey on social
          media focusing on the process of building an application and engaging
          with our potential users.

        </h1>
        <h3 class="secondary-heading">Our Target Market:</h3>
        <div class="main-text">
          The name Genzi was chosen to represent a generation that is not afraid
          to speak up, express themselves, and share their achievements and
          opinions with others online. As the name suggests, our primary target
          is Generation Z. As we continue to grow on social media, our analytics
          show a strong following from the age of 16 to 24 located in Spain.
        </div>
        <h3 class="secondary-heading">Market Analysis:</h3>
        <div class="main-text">
          Understanding our demographics and target market enabled us to
          understand how to proceed. We determined that our primary demographics
          would be Spain and Latam given there is no such application for this
          market. As we researched and experienced the competitors&#x27; apps,
          we created an empathy map. Information was gathered from different
          sources where most of the users participated including the
          competitors&#x27; apps, TikTok, Reddit, and Twitter.

        </h1>
        <h3 class="secondary-heading">Product Design:</h3>
        <div class="main-text">
          During the lo-fi creation of the application, a big-picture storyboard
          was created. After understanding the market&#x27;s needs, we focused
          on what showcasing what the user needs, their context, and why the app
          will be useful for them. This allowed us to understand the key
          features that are essential for the minimum viable product (MVP)
          version. A website landing page was created where potential users can
          register on the waiting list by submitting an email address. As the
          lo-fi version was determined, I proceed to create the hi-fi version of
          the app using tools such as Figma, Illustrator, and Webflow.
        </div>
        <h3 class="secondary-heading">Content Creation:</h3>
        <div class="main-text">
          Creating an audience for a social media platform that does not exist
          was going to be hard, or so we thought so. Our focus was to create
          videos on TikTok and Instagram and within a few months, our videos
          reached 500,000+ views, 32,000+ likes, and 300+ waiting list
          registrations. On TikTok, we focused on engaging with the audience but
          showing our journey and creating interactive videos. While on
          Instagram, posts and stories were mostly created. These videos and
          posts were mostly edited with Premiere Pro, Illustrator, and Canvas.

        <h3 class="secondary-heading">Ongoing Project:</h3>
        <div class="main-text">
          As of September 2022, the hi-fi version of Genzi has been finished, we
          continue to grow our audience on social media, and we are currently
          raising capital to develop and launch the first version of the app. I
          am a firm believer that the need to create new experiences and bond
          with others is innate to every single one of us and Genzi will be
          there to make it happen.
